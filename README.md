# E-commerce Back End Database

## Description
A bare bones database for back-end users to manage retail inventory. Tables include categories, tags, and individual products. Users can search for all items within a category, tag or product, or they can search for an individual category, tag, or product by using the category-id, tag-id, or product-id, respectively. The app also allows the user to create, update, and delete their categories, tags, and products.
